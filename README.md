# BlockChain Library Suite
[日本語](READMEjp.md)

## about blocks
blocks is a iOS library as introduce BlockChain System to your Apps, based on Satoshi Nakamoto's Paper,
for various purpose (*** Exclude exchangeable digital currency in cryptocurrency exchange ***) iOS App.  

Characteristically, blocks is pre-contained Activities in Social System (Government, Public, Private Sectors) as Birth Registration, Residential Record, Guarantor.

It is depend on overlayNetwork library.

## about overlayNetwork
overlayNetwork is a iOS library as Peer-to-Peer Overlay Network Communicate System, based on Distributed Hash Table Lookup Protocol MIT Laboratory's Paper named Chord.  

Nothing depending other libraries.

## about Testy
Testy is alternative to Basic Resident Register Card.  

It is made as Reference iOS App based on blocks and overlayNetwork libraries.

## about Signaling
Signaling coordinate Node to Node Communication (TCP/IP) in Overlay Network, with NAT Traverse,
as Translate OverlayNetworkAddress to IP/Port.

Signaling emit signal at claim by Nodes in Cloud (Python).

Signaling make NAT Traverse in Overlay Network.

## How to Use
### Swift Package (Recommended)
1) Open Testy Project or Your App Project in Xcode.  
2) File - Add Packages
3) Input following blocks URL to Search or Enter Package URL Box on UpRight.
https://github.com/webbananaunite/blocks
4) You see blocks library's README.md.
5) Tap Add Package Button on DownRight.
6) Make Sure there Added blocks library in Project - Frameworks, Libraries and Embeded Content.
7) Make Sure there Added The BlockChain Library Suite(blocks and overlayNetwork libraries) at Package Dependencies in Project Navigator in Xcode.
8) At First, a Simulator / Device must run as Boot Node.
   For App run as Boot Node, Set {RunAsBootNode} as Run Argument / Environment Variable on Edit Scheme on Xcode.
9) Xcode Build and Install Devices or Simulators.  
10) Open App and Tap "Join blocks Network" Button.  
11) Wait Around 8 min. up to Done Initialize DHC table.  
### Carthage
- $ cd your project directory
- $ echo 'github "webbananaunite/blocks" "carthage"' > Cartfile
- $ carthage update --use-xcframeworks
### CocoaPods
- $ cd your project directory
- $ pod init
- $ vi Podfile
```
target 'target name in your App proj' do
  use_frameworks!
    pod 'blocks-blockchain'
end
```
- $ pod install
- Open your app.xcworkspace created by pod.

## limitations
NOT running Boot Node in Public Network yet in Beta Version. Cause First device must run as Boot Node. 

## license
blocks library & overlayNetwork library & Testy is published under MIT License,  
as embedding your apps, any who can use any purpuse (*** Exclude exchangeable digital currency in cryptocurrency exchange ***). by free.

## prohibited matter
Use as exchangeable digital currency in cryptocurrency exchange is PROHIBITED.

## description
### words:
- Baby Sitter

As A Node Joinning Overlay Network in OSI Session Layer, At First, Take Baby Sitter Node's IP and Port From TXT Record in bind Server.  
Then Send FS Command to Baby Sitter Node for any Entry in Distributed Hush Table (Code Protocol).  

- Taker

First of All, As Joinning blocks Block Chain Network in OSI Presentation/Application Layer, The Node Should Submit Application for Birth Registration to The Network.
No There Administrator Node/Person In The Network, The Node Should Find Taker Node for Send AT (Ask For Taker) Claim as Publish Transaction.

- Book

What Wrote blocks Block Chain.

- Booker

The Booker Node Collect Non-Booked Transactions, Do Proof of Work as Calculate A Nonce, Publish Block.  
As Firstest and Legitimate Nonce Value than Other Node, The Node be Booker.  
The Booker Do Beheivier as Temporary Administrator of Book (blocks Block Chain) Up to Next Proof of Work.

### language:  
- SwiftUI (Protocol Oriented) 
- C++ (Metal) 
- objc (DNS resolv)
- Python (Signaling)

### using 3rd party libraries
Nothing, but program include other one copyrights.  
- QuadKey - Microsoft Corporation  
- SHA-512 - Aaron D. Gifford

### programming architecture:  
around DDD, Onion (Protocol Oriented)

### byteOrder:  
- Distributed Hash Table (Finger table) address  
Little Endian

- nonce  
Little Endian

### cpu, gpu
nonce calculator is choosable cpu or gpu.

## status
Beta  

Have NOT all done functions implementation.  
- ex. Leaving and returning from DHT Network in overlayNetwork.  

All implemented version is planned Release at May 2024.  

Interested in Building Social Infrastructure by Peer-to-Peer Overlay Network, Block-chain System, On volunteer, please join my Project.  

but, Don't accept application from one related to Cryptocurrency Exchange.  

Let's Have fun!
